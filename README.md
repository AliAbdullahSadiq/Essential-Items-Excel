# Essential-Items-Excel
An excel list of essential items required when you move houses. Initially found on Tumblr from user iamwerewolfroyalty.

This list called "ULTIMATE “OH FUCK I JUST GOT MY FIRST APARTMENT AND ALL I HAVE IS ONE CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND A THIRD SOCK” CHECKLIST" can be found [here.](https://idkhumor.tumblr.com/post/123095673105/ultimate-oh-fuck-i-just-got-my-first-apartment)

I converted it to excel, then wrote a script to automate removing all the gaps it had.

Was there an easier way to do this? probably...
